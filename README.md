# About the Project
The JDS6600 is a 2-channel DDS signal generator witha built-in frequency counter. It comes in a few flafours, one cam generate signals up to 60MHz, the lite version only up to 15MHz
The Signal generator can be controlled via a USB port, and via the control panel.
This module makes it easier to control the signal generator via the USB port. It abstacts most of 
functions offered via the remote control.
The documentation I have found on the internmanufacturer's website (https://joy-it.net/de/products/JT-JDS6600), is not very clear and it seems that not all options which are available via manual control, are possible via the remote control.
I've also found out the the sgnal generator was available from another company, called Hangzou Junce Instruments.
